Version Control is what git and github are for. They allow for teams to update a repository at different times and with more "data insurance".

Git and Github are different because Git is the controller and Git hub is a repository or what the controller interfaces with while a project is going on.

Git Clone :  This clones a file from your repository (github, for example), and trasnfers it to a file folder in your desired location.

Git Status  :  This collects the current version control and identify any problems

Git Add  :  This takes a file and attempts to merge it with the main branch of saved data that you are interacting with.

Git Commit -m "" : This is the confirmation for git add, and allows you to attach messages to your work so that you can track your work and be neat

Git Push : This sends the file to the git repository
